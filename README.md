# sdonidle

Windows Task Scheduler is cancer so this C++ code will simply shutdown windows if the mouse has not moved in 4 hours.

Change idle time with shortcut to sdonidle.exe 
(Shutdown after 60s: Target = " 'C:\your\path\to\sdonidle.exe' 60 ")

Place exe or shortcut into Startup Folder 
"C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup"
